pdfmake: This version has the code below implemented. It has not been fully tested except within this app.

As mentioned before, if you simply place a URL in a pdf, most PDF renderers (adobe etc.)  seems to be able to detect the link and allow the user to click on it.
If you "open" pdfmake output to a browser, Chrome, IE seems to recognize the link, but Firefox will not.

Therefor:  {text: "www.example.org"} generally works if that is what you want to display in the pdf.


To create a proper link within the pdf, you need to use the following syntax.

dd.content.push({text: "link" , link: 'www.google.com', decoration:"underline"});   -- see sample output (notice extra link at bottom)
However, there is a bug in pdfMake that doesn't fully implement the syntax.

Adding the following code to PDFMake.js fixes the problem:

athavanraja commented on Nov 24, 2015 
made the following change in pdfmake.js to make it work.
var data = this.textTools.buildInlines(node.text, styleStack); 
// new code after the above line . (line no. 15795)
// added by raja
if(node.link)
{
for(var di = 0, dl = data.items.length; di < dl; di++) {
data.items[di].link = node.link ;
}
}
// end of addition

pdfMakeHTMLConverter:

211 data contains some HTML which I need to put in the pdf.

I took the solution here and massaged it a little for this application.
